# TV Time Backup Tool
This is a tool made in Python that allows users to backup saved shows (and their progress) from an account in TV Time.
Special thanks to [Kwbmm](https://github.com/Kwbmm) for creating [this](https://github.com/Kwbmm/scraped-tvtime-api) tool, from which I took snippets of code to build the scaper part of the tool.
